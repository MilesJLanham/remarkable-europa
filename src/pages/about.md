I am **Miles Lanham**, a user experience design student at Eastern Washington University.

My work has earned a design internship at ThyssenKrupp Online Metals. This internship has since turned into a freelance relationship in which they contact me if they need any assistance with design. I have a passion for user experience design and making products easier and more enjoyable to use. I would love to work on a creative team that either makes websites, applications, and/or games. As a principle, I believe it’s incredibly important to design responsibly and with the user’s best interest at heart. As a UX designer, it’s my job to know what users want and how they think and it would be wrong of me to use that information to exploit them. Currently, I am good at presenting ideas and making layouts that are easy to follow. I would like to get better at making these layouts more interesting to look at and coding these designs so I can get a better idea of what is possible to design.
