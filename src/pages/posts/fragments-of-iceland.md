subtitle: A study In Empowering The Client
---

As Studio Jacks is going through a major change in their business they want a new modern website to take a fresh step forward. In addition, they want a strong and bold look to help them stand out from the competition. I need to make sure that while staying true to the current brand, we will make a new website that is easier to use and more visually appealing.
However, there is one major limitation. The client isnâ€™t the most tech savy and wants to keep their website on squarespace. This is entirley workable but it brings up another question. What will the client do when I have finished the project but they want to make changes or add to the website? To work with this, on top of designing the website I am going to teach Jack how to use Squarspace and create a written out plan to help him add to his blog or make any updates that he needs to make.

In order to help Jack and his business there is a couple of steps we are going to have to take.
