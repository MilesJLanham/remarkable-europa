As Studio Jacks is going through a major change in their business they want a new modern website to take a fresh step forward. In addition, they want a strong and bold look to help them stand out from the competition. I need to make sure that while staying true to the current brand, we will make a new website that is easier to use and more visually appealing.
However, there is one major limitation. The client isnâ€™t the most tech savy and wants to keep their website on squarespace. This is entirley workable but it brings up another question. What will the client do when I have finished the project but they want to make changes or add to the website? To work with this, on top of designing the website I am going to teach Jack how to use Squarspace and create a written out plan to help him add to his blog or make any updates that he needs to make.

In order to help Jack and his business there is a couple of steps we are going to have to take.

**Step One:** Identifying issues with the current website.

At first glance The web site feels empty. There is far too much white Space. The type on the images are hard to read as it is dark text on a black and white image. Some of the information seems redundant and several of the links on the home page take you back to the home page. Usability leaves quite a bit to be desired. I have difficulty finding their  location and contact nformation. Upon looking at their competition this website feels far too similar yet falls even shorter due to the anemic design.

**Step Two:** Planning.

At this phase I boxed out the main parts of the existing websites in their colors and began to play with color. While experimenting I decided to grab some colors from the existing logo and tried to see what would go well with it. A big issue was while white worked it was boring and plain. Then I realized. I am not a fan of the basic white web page background. It is hard on the eyes and can give a user a headache. So I began to play around with some darker colors and found one I enjoyed. This helped a ton and made the webpage feel more full and allowed me to keep much of the original feel and look of the design while making the website feel more complete overall. For the text and buttons I decided to use the brown in the logo and it came out great. It is readable and adds a nice clean feel to it. In addition I added their location and contact information to the footer and main page to make sure people can find and contact them easily no matter where they are in the website.

**Step Three:**
This is the phase where I put all that planning into practice. I designed a layout and sent it off to the client and waited for some feedback. I got the necesary feedback and the client worried that the first design wasnt strong enough and the green buttons distracted him. I took his feedback and darkened some of the boxes and chose a more angular font. After some layout adjustments I sent it off to the client again and they loved it. While There are some things that will change in teh near future this is the home page currently

**Final Step**

This brings us to our final part of the proces. Helping the client own their website. Working with my client we wrote down all of the steps it will take him to write a blog post. The first thing we did was write his keyboard shortcuts at the top of the page in his notebook. After that we workshopped his process. First, he opens a google doc and writes his post. Then he copy and pastes his post into the grammarly browser extension in which he revises his post. After he has revised it he takes the post into square space in which he creates a new blog post which is very easy for him given their strong UI and a walk through from me. Then he pastes his blog entry into square space and formats it as he needs. Once that is all done he posts it and shares the link to his friends and social media. This process worked well and we used it to create his first post, The 100. Along with blog posts we will be going over how to use every aspect of SquareSpace so he can truly own his website.
