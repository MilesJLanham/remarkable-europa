**Summary**

The Eastern Washington Universty Design department is looking for a way to commemerate and remember its seniors. We have been tasked with designing a fun and interesting way. We have to show an image of the student, their bio, name, and motto. Last but most importantly we must think of a way to incorporate an NFC scanner. When the sticker is scanned it must bring up the correct students profile with the required information.

**Step One:** Create a use for the NFC Scanner

My team and I started the project the same way all great projects start, a guided brainstorm. After going through ideas we asked ourselves what meaning we want our idea to have. We thought we want it to be representative of each student and personal to them. For this we decided to use laminated cards printed with each students logo. The NFC sticker can be mounted on the back so it doesnt interfere with the design of the over all look of the design.  The next problem to solve was how to display these cards. At first we thought of a table but tables can get messy if people dont put them back perfectly so we needed a better idea. We thought of using a wall. This technique is great in the sense that by having all of the design students logos on a wall the viewer can see how each student wishes to represent themselves. In addition, it would help keep things organized and you dont have to worry about a table getting messy. In addition, this method allows us to treat each of these logos/cards as the pieces of art that they are and will give the room a gallery effect. This Solution also brought an issue. How do we put the cards on the wall? For this we decided to use those transparent wallmounted card holders. This will give us the feeling of these logos being the high art that they are.

**Step Two:** Create A style Template

Our group went through a long design process with a lot of revisions. Until we found the design we thought fit best.

**Step Three: Design**

While the style template didn't stay the same through our prototyping/designing as we didnâ€™t want to commit right off the bat and have some freedom to play with our layout. We started by choosing a font, Monstserrat, and some colors, red.

**Final Design:**

With our last design we were enjoying the sharper corners. So much that we deicided to take them away to give the content boxes a more mordern feel. Going with this modern feel we decided to grab a dark grey for the background and a desaturated red for the containers. We also moved the QR code to the students profile to help enforce the idea of the QR code giving more information about the student rather than teh senior project.
